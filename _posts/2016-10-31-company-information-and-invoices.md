Ever since we launched our new website, we have been striving to improve it!Â 
Last week, we added very useful information tools for our customers...   
This week, we are introducing one of those tools that includes a feature that will allow our customers to keep track of their credit, sales orders, invoices and even allow them to download that information on Excel files.    
In order to take advantage of this feature, you must sign in to your Vertilux account.
[Registration Tutorial - Sing in](/post/how-to-sign-up).   

### Step 1
After you have successfully signed in to your Vertilux account, click on the
symbol located in the upper right corner of your screen.

Then, click on Account Profile:

### Step 2
This will direct you to your User Account page, where you can update your personal
information, view your favorite products and request access to your current transactions with Vertilux:

Then you will be asked for your Vertilux Account Number:

Once you have access to your company's information, you will notice that your profiel has automatically been updated.   
Now, you have on the left side a menu specific to your company, with invoices, sales orders and details.
