Ever since we launched our new website, we have been striving to improve it!Â 
Last week, we added very useful information tools for our customers.   
This week, we are intriducing one of those tools that includes a feature that will allow our customers to keep track of their credit, sales orders, invoices and even allowing to download that information on Excel files.    
In order to take advantage of this feature, you must sign in to your Vertilux account.
[Sign in - Sign up Tutorial](/post/how-to-sign-up).   

### Step 1
After you have successfully signed in to your Vertilux account, click on the
symbol located in the upper right corner of your screen.

Then, click on Account Profile:

### Step 2
This will direct you to your User Account page, where you can update your personal
information, view your favorite products and request access to your company information:

Then you will be asked for your Vertilux Account Number:

Normally you should have acces in less than 24 hours:

Once you have access to your company info, you will notice your profile had changed.
Now, you have on the left a menu for your company, with the Company Details, Invoices
and Sales Orders.
