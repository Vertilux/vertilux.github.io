Since we launched our new website we have been improving it.   
Last week we just add an very good tool for our customer, now they can see their invocies from our website, and even downloaded them to an excel file.    
The only required to have access is to get an account. [Sign in - Sign up Tutorial](/post/how-to-sign-up).   

### Step 1
After you have sucessfully signed-in visit your account profile:

Then:
![Acount Profile Link](/assets/images/posts/account_profile_link.png)   

### Step 2
After that you will be prompted to your Profile, where you can see an update your information, view your favorites products and your invoices:   
![Acount Profile](/assets/images/posts/profile.png)   

Now, if you want to see your invoices just click the Invoices tad. You should see the lastest invoices.

### Step 3
In case the invoice you are looking for is not listed you can allways list all your invocies. Including and search form where you can search for:   
- Invoice number
- Company name
- Order number
- Freight
- etc.   

Or, if your invocie is on the list click on the invoice number, this will redirect you to the invocie detail:

To download your invoice just click the button Download Excel.
