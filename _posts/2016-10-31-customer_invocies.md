Ever since we launched our new website, we have been striving to improve it. 
Last week, we added a very useful tool for our customers. This week, we are 
introducing a feature that will allow our customers to keep track of their 
invoices and even download them as Excel files. To take advantage of this 
feature you must sign in to your Vertilux account.
[Sign in - Sign up Tutorial](/post/how-to-sign-up).   

### Step 1
After you have successfully signed in to your Vertilux account, click on the 
symbol located in the upper right corner of your screen.

This will direct you to your User Account page, where you can update your personal 
information, view your favorite products and your latest invoices:

### Step 3
Clicking on the Invoices tab will automatically display your 10 latest invoices. 
If you are looking for a previous invoice, click on the Load All Invoices button.   
You can also use the search button to search for a specific invoice. You can search 
by invoice number, company name, order number, freight, etc.   
Once you find the invoice you are looking for, click on the invoice number to see 
the invoice details.
