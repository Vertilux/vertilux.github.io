look up the item with the magnify glass.

2. After you select the item go to the location where you want to pull the item from. Also,
if you need to know from what location you need the item, click on the magnify glass, and
that will open a window with all the info of the locations and quantities for each location.

you can comment any single line.   
**NOTE**: If you need a comment this must entered before save the new document, very important
to remember, if You SAVE the document that will generate the request AUTOMATICALLY to the
Warehouse and then you will be initiated the process. Any other comment after you save the
process won’t be pass in the document to the warehouse departments.

the items. If they notice any discrepancy or need to adjust the quantity or location. Under the
portal assigned to them, they can do it without generate any extra communication to the person who
is requesting the samples. As soon they completed the document, they will mark the document as prepared.
